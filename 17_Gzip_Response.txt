### Gzip Response ###
How fast a website will load depends on the size of all of the files that have to be downloaded by the browser.
Reducing the size of files to be transmitted can make the website not only load faster, but also cheaper to those who have to pay for their bandwidth usage.
Response files can be minimise by configure Nginx to use gzip to compress files it serves on the fly.
Compressing files use up server resources, so it is best to compress only those files that will reduce its size considerably in result.

*jpg, jpeg, png tidak di compress karena secara default sudah di compress
