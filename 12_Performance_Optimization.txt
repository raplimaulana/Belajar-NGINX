### Performance Optimization ###
Nginx ----> RAM Memory
      ----> System Memory 

Buffer Size is another aspect to manage the Nginx Performance.
If the buffer sizes are too low, then Nginx will have to write to a temporary file causing the disk to read and write constantly.

1. client_body_buffer_size
   This handles the client buffer size, meaning any POST actions sent to Nginx. 
   POST actions are typically form submissions.

2. client_header_buffer_size 
   Similar to the previous directive, only instead it handles the client header size.

3. client_max_body_size 
   The maximum allowed size for a client request. 
   If the maximum size is exceeded, then Nginx will spit out a 413 error or Request Entity Too Large.

4. large_client_header_buffers
   The maximum number and size of buffers for large client.

5. client_body_timeout and client_header_timeout 
   Both directives are responsible for the time a server will wait for a client body or client header to be sent after request. 
   If neither a body or header is sent, the server will issue a 408 error or Request time out.

6. keepalive_timeout 
   Assigns the timeout for keep-alive connections with the client. 
   Nginx will close connections with the client after this period of time.

7. gzip
   Gzip can help reduce the amount of network transfer Nginx deals with. 
   However, be careful increasing the gzip_comp_level too high as the server will begin wasting cpu cycles.

   gzip on;
   gzip_comp_level 2;
   gzip_min_length 1000;
   gzip_types text/plain application/x-javascript text/xml text/css
   application/xml

8. Static File Caching 
   It’s possible to set expire headers for files that don’t change and are served regularly. 
   This directive can be added to the actual Nginx server block.

   location ~* .(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js)$ {
       expires 365d;
   }




### Configuration Nginx ###
#File Configuration 
nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    worker_connections 1024;
}

    client_body_buffer_size 10K;
    client_max_body_size 8m;

    #Buffer size for headers
    client_header_buffer_size 1k;

    #Max time to receive client headers/body 
    client_body_timeout 12;
    client_header_timeout 12;

    #Max time to keep a connection open for
    keepalive_timeout 15;

    #Max time for the client accept/receive a response 
    send_timeout 10;

    #Skip buffering for static files 
    sendfile on;

    #Optimise sendfile packets
    tcp_nopush on;
